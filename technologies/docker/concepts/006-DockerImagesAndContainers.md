# Description: Docker Images and Containers

### Docker Images Vs Docker Containers
* Docker Image: An image is the application we want to run.
* Docker Container: A Container is an instance of that image running as a process.
* Docker Registry: Docker's default image "registry" is called [Docker Hub](hub.docker.com).
* Docker Images Vs Docker Container: There can be many containers running off the same image.
