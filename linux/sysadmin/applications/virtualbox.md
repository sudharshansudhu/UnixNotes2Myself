# Description: VirtualBox Administration on Ubuntu

### Install Oracle VirtualBox
```
sudo sh -c 'echo ""deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib"" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3
```

### Setup Host-Only Static IP for VirtualBox Guests
A typical setup VirtualBox uses two NICs. The first uses NAT to allow the box to communicate with the outside world through the host computerâ€™s network connection. NAT is the default and does not require any setup. The second uses a "host-only" connection that allows the host and guest to interact.

Ceate a host-only connection in VirtualBox by opening the VirtualBox - File - Preferences - Network - Host-only Network tab. Click on "+" to add a new network "vboxnet0". Click on "Edit" to modify the host-only network, and disable DHCP. Make a note of the IP address if needed.

Now assign this host-only adapter to the virtual machine. Select the VM Guest - Settings - Network. Select "Adpater 2". Enable the adapter, set it to a "Host-only Adapter", and select the adpater "vboxnet0" created in the above steps.

Add the static IP permanently to the VM guest. 

```bash
# On VM GUEST: Modify the configuration file /etc/network/interfaces to configure eth1 to use a static IP address when the system starts.
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

# The host-only network interface
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.56.101
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.56.0
broadcast 192.168.56.255
```

Now access the VM Guest from the Host by adding entries in /etc/hosts file of the Host. 

### Setup USB Drive for VirtualBox Guests
#### One Time Setup
- Install VirtualBox Extension Pack which brings in the support for USB 3.0 interface. Download VirtualBox Extension Pack from the VirtualBox website.
- From VirtualBox main window, go to File -> Preferences -> Extensions. Click on "Add new package". Navigate to downloaded extension file and install.
- Add current users to the vboxusers group.

```bash
# Add the current user to the group vboxusers
sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER

# Logout and login to check if the user is added to the group
groups $USER
```
- Reboot host machine and USB is setup.

#### Inserting and Ejecting a USB Disk
- Start a VM Guest. 
- Insert the USB drive.
- Go to top menu on Guest -> Device -> USB -> USB Disk 3.0 [0100]. Now the USB disk will be available on the Guest and removed from the host.
- Eject the USB disk after use.
