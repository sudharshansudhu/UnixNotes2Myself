# Description: GNU Parted - A Partition Manipulation Program

# Notes
# 1. The parted command is a disk partitioning and partition resizing program.
# 2. The GNU parted command with GPT can be used to create Linux filesystems greater than 2 Terabytes which is not
#    possible with fdisk commands.
# 3. It can be used to create, destroy, resize, move and copy ext2, linux-swap, FAT, FAT32, and reiserfs partitions. It
#    can create, resize, and move Macintosh HFS partitions, as well as detect jfs, ntfs, ufs, and xfs partitions.
# 4. It is  useful  for  creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and copying data to new
#    hard disks.
# 5. The parted command supports Intel EFI/GPT partition tables. GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a standard for the layout
#    of the partition table on a physical hard disk. It is a part of the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) standard
#    proposed by Intel as a replacement for the outdated PC BIOS, one of the few remaining relics of the original IBM
#    PC. EFI uses GPT where BIOS uses a Master Boot Record (MBR).
# 6. Refer [GUID Partition Table Scheme](parted.png): It illustrates the layout of the GUID Partition Table scheme. Each
#    logical block (LBA) is 512 bytes in size. LBA addresses that are negative indicate position from the end of the
#    volume, with -1 being the last addressable block.

# Common Examples
sudo parted -l
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb

# Examples with details
sudo parted /dev/sdb            # Initiate the interactive command line menu to perform various tasks on /dev/sdb.
                                # Type 'help' to see all the options. Type the following in (parted) commandline.
mklabel gpt                     # Creates a new GPT disklabel i.e. partition table:
                                # Type 'Yes' to confirm to "Warning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdb will be
                                # destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue?"
unit TB                         # Set the default unit to TB.
mkpart primary 0.00TB 4.00TB    # Create a 4TB partition size,
print                           # Print the current partitions.
quit                            # Quit and save the changes.
                                # After quitting, format the filesystem using mkfs and mount it manually using mount
                                # command or automatically using fstab.
