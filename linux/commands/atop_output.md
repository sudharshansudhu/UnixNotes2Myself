### Section 2: Process Level View
* About
    - This section shows process level information.
    - This has the detailed information related to the processes from which the resource utilization has changed 
      during the last interval (a default interval is 10 seconds).
    - Each row displays 
    - PID           : Process-id. If a process has been started and finished during the last interval, a `?' is shown.
    - SYSCPU        : CPU time consumption of this process in system mode (kernel mode), usually due to system call handling.
    - USRCPU        : CPU time consumption of this process in user mode, due to processing the own program text.
    - VGROW         : The amount of virtual memory that the process has grown during the last interval.
    - RGROW         : The  amount  of  resident memory that the process has grown during the last interval. 
    - RUID          : The real user-id under which the process executes.
    - EUID          : Effective user-id under which this process executes.
    - ST            : The status of a process.
                      - First Position: The first position indicates if the process has been started during the last 
                        interval. N means 'new process'.
                      - Second position: The second position indicates if the process has been finished during the last 
                        interval. E means 'exit' on the process' own initiative; the exit code is displayed in the 
                        column EXC. The value S means that the process has been terminated unvoluntarily by a signal; 
                        the signal number is displayed in the in the column EXC. The value C means that the process 
                        has been terminated unvoluntarily by a signal, producing a core dump in its current directory; 
                        the signal number is displayed  in the column EXC.
    - EXC           : The exit code of a terminated process (second position of column ST is E) or the fatal signal 
                      number (second position of column ST is S or C).
    - THR           : Total  number  of  threads within this process.
    - S             : The current state of the (main) thread: R for running (currently processing or in the runqueue),

                      Z for zombie (waiting to be synchronized with its parent process), T for stopped (suspended or 
                      traced), W for swapping, and E (exit) for processes which have finished during the last interval.
    - CPUNR         : The identification of the CPU the (main) thread is running on or has recently been running on.
    - CPU           : The occupation percentage of this process related to the available capacity for this resource on 
                      system level.
