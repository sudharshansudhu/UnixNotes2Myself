# Description: atop - AT Computing's System & Process Monitor

# Notes
# - The atop is an open source tool to monitor system and processes and log its history.
# - Install atop using the command `sudo apt-get install atop`.
# - The default configuration file is available on the path `/etc/default/atop`.
# - The default log file is available on the path `/var/log/atop/atop_YYYYMMDD`.
# - Stop atop accounting by sending kill -15. Never shutdown atop using kill -9 because system accounting files
#   will continue to grow.

# Advantages of atop
# - The atop stays active in the background for long-term server analysis which is up to 28 days by default.
# - The atop daemon writes snapshots to a compressed log file which can be read using atop or atopsar command.
# - The atop shows resource usage of ALL processes, even those that are closed/completed.
# - The atop monitors threads within processes & ignores processes that are unused.
# - The atop accumulates resource usage for all processes and users with the same name.
# - The atop highlights critical resources using colors (red).
# - The atop will add or remove columns as the size of the display window changes.
# - The atop can monitor disk I/O and network utilization also.
# - The atop uses netatop kernel module to monitor TCP & UDP and network bandwidth.

# Sorting atop Output
# Once atop is running, either live or the log files, use the following shortcut keys to sort processes.
# c - Sort by cpu consumption (default).
# a - Sort in order of most active resource.
# d - Sort in order of disk activity.
# m - Sort in order of memory usage
# n - Sort in order of network activity

# Navigate atop Log Files
# t - Go forward in 10 minute intervals.
# T - Go backward in 10 minute intervals.
# b - Go to a snapshop at a particular time. Enter the time in format hh:mm after pressing b.

# Setup custom Interval for atop
# Edit the file /etc/default/atop and update the default value for INTERVAL=60 to INTERVAL=30 and restart service.

# Common Examples
sudo atop
sudo atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20170829
sudo systemctl restart atop.service

# Examples with details
systemctl restart atop.service      # Restart atop service after editing the config file /etc/default/atop.
atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_20170829 # Read atop compressed and binary log files.

atop -a                             # Display active processes only.
atop -y                             # Display individual threads.
atop -1                             # Display average-per-second total values.
atop -m                             # Display memory related process info.
atop -d                             # Display disk related process info.
atop -n                             # Display network related process info. This requires plugin.
atop -s                             # Display scheduling related process info.
atop -v                             # Display various process info like ppid, user/group, date/time.
atop -c                             # Display command line per process.
