# Description: Get Random Bytes

# Notes
# 1. There are 2 special commands that work like files - /dev/random and /dev/urandom.
# 2. ALWAYS use /dev/urandom
#    - If you need a certain number of random bytes, read that number of bytes from /dev/urandom.
#    - It is a "special file" that is made to be like a file to read random numbers from.
#    - Using cat to read from /dev/urandom is a bad idea, because it will try to read /dev/urandom to the end - but it
#      does not end.
#    - You can use head. But take care to read by byte, not by line - because lines would be randomly separated by
#      random newline bytes.
# 3. NEVER use /dev/random
#    - Normally, you want to use /dev/urandom, not /dev/random.
#    - The problem is that /dev/random is hard to use in the right way - and easy to use in a wrong way. Using it wrong
#      works at first, but creates strange - even random - performance problems later. Sometimes.
#    - When you use /dev/urandom, it makes use of /dev/random internally, taking care of the tricky parts.

# Common Examples
head -c 30 /dev/urandom

# Examples with details
head -c 30 /dev/urandom     # Read 30 bytes from the device /dev/urandom
