% Description: Tables in Latex

% Note
% 1.  LaTeX offers the table and tabular environment for table creation.
% 2.  The table environment acts like a wrapper for the tabular similar to the figure environment.
% 3.  Alignment and vertical separators are passed as an argument to the tabular environment. Eg,
%           \begin{tabular}{l|c||r}
% 4.  It's possible to align the content left (l), centered (c) and right (r), where the number of alignment operators
%     has to match the desired number of columns.
% 5.  The columns can be seperated by adding | in between the alignment operators.
% 6.  Rows can be seperated using the \hline command and columns using the ampersand & symbol.
% 7.  The newline \\ operator indicates the end of a row.
% 8.  It's possible to refer to tables using \ref and \label.
% 9.  Align numbers at the decimal point using the siunitx package.
% 10. Combine multiple rows and columns with the multirow package.
% 11. Prettify your tables using the booktabs package.
% 12. Make your tables span multiple pages with the longtable package.
% 13. Display your tables in landscape using the rotating package.
